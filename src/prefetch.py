"""
Prefetch module for SABRE dynamic buffering.

Decides *when* and *where* to prefetch based on:
- A JSON config that lists target segment indices and a buffer-level threshold

Bitrate / quality selection is delegated to the ABR algorithm via the standard
``abr.get_quality_delay(segment_index)`` interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config_path : str | Path
        Path to a JSON file with the format::

            {
              "buffer_level_threshold": 20000,

        required before a prefetch download is triggered (``should_prefetch``
        uses ``buffer_level_ms > threshold``). Verbose logs print
        ``bl=<before>-><after>``: *before* is the level when the prefetch
        download **starts** (must exceed the threshold); *after* is the
        level once the download completes and the chunk is added (often lower
        if the buffer drained during the download).
