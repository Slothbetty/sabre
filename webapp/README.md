# Image Board Prototype

This simple web application converts an uploaded image to SVG using [ImageTracer.js](https://github.com/jankovicsandras/imagetracerjs) and places it on a fixed-size board (100mm Ã— 50mm). The user can drag the resulting SVG anywhere on the board and adjust its height via a range slider.

To run, open `index.html` in a browser.
